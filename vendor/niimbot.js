/* ── niimbot.js — Web Bluetooth driver for Niimbot printers ───────────────────
 * Generic and application-agnostic. Protocol V4, with two print-task variants:
 *   "v4"  D11 / B1 Pro / B21 Pro line (300 dpi)  — validated on real B1 Pro
 *   "b1"  B1 / B21 line (203 dpi)                 — see registry.json `task`
 * Reverse-engineered against niimbluelib; the task is chosen per model.
 *
 * No dependencies, no build. Load with <script src="niimbot.js"></script> and
 * use the global `window.Niimbot` API. It reads no config of its own and owns no
 * UI — the app passes the printer model and label size (see registry.json). It
 * does `fetch` the image URL it is given and rasterize it on an offscreen
 * <canvas> (`imageToPacked`); nothing is added to the page.
 *
 *   await Niimbot.printImage(pngUrl, { model, size, onProgress });
 *   await Niimbot.printBatch([url1, url2], { model, size, onProgress });
 *
 * Both RESOLVE only when the printer confirmed the job — every page acknowledged
 * and the printed-page counter reaching the total. If it did not, they REJECT
 * with a message naming what stalled and where, after sending PrintEnd so the
 * paper is still fed out. They used to resolve either way, which is how a run
 * that printed 4 of 5 labels reported success (measured 2026-08-13). Treat a
 * rejection as "check the paper", not as "nothing printed": some of it did.
 *
 *   model: { name_prefixes:[], task, density, label_type, speed }  (from registry.json)
 *   size:  { w_px, h_px }                                      (from registry.json)
 *
 * Requirements: a browser with Web Bluetooth, over HTTPS (or localhost). Which
 * browsers qualify (and the iOS polyfill route) is in the README's Requirements
 * table — check Niimbot.isSupported() before offering it.
 *
 * Print flow (one job, N pages): connect → SetDensity → SetLabelType →
 *   PrintStart (declares N pages) → for each page: SetPageSize → rows
 *   (0x84 empty / 0x85 with pixels, run-length) → PageEnd (0xE3) → … →
 *   PrintEnd (0xF3) once at the end.
 *
 *   PrintEnd (0xF3) is what feeds out + retracts the paper, so it runs exactly
 *   once per job, not per page — otherwise the printer stops and pulls the paper
 *   back between every label. Pages are pipelined with a look-ahead (the next page
 *   is queued while the current one prints, throttled via the 0xA3→0xB3 status
 *   counter), which removes the retract between labels.
 *
 *   It does NOT always remove the PAUSE between labels, and this comment used to
 *   claim it did. Whether the paper keeps moving depends on which is faster, the
 *   send or the print. Measured on a B1 Pro, 2026-08-13, dense pages in "paced":
 *   ~255 row-writes × PACE_MS 10 ms ⇒ ~3 s to send a page, while the printer
 *   finished one in less — so it waited, and the pause is visible on the paper
 *   path. In "fast" the send is quick enough that the same batch streams. The
 *   look-ahead hides latency; it cannot create bandwidth.

  // Nothing ever measured that. As of 2026-08-13 the score is: THREE confirmed failures
  // in "fast" (a non-Mac desktop and an iPhone, both on dense content, plus the macOS
  // blank-page history) and ZERO confirmed successes in "fast" — every print known to
  // have succeeded either ran "paced" or ran on a machine whose OS nobody recorded.
  // Whether any platform actually needs the unpaced path is still open; see

  // contains "like Mac OS X", and iOS is CoreBluetooth as well. The consequence is that
  // an iPhone has only ever printed PACED — whether it needs to is unmeasured. See the
  // write-mode override below, which is what makes that measurable.
  // MAC_SOURCE records WHICH input decided IS_MAC, and it is printed on the connect
  // line. Reason: on 2026-08-13 the same Chrome on the same Mac logged `mac=true` in one
  // session and `mac=false` in another, and `mac=false` alone could not say why — the
  // value is computed once at load, so the difference had to be in what `navigator`

  // be flipped on an already-open connection, and `writeMode` above keeps reporting what
  // was DETECTED — the two are separate on purpose, so a log line can show both.
  //
  // Why it must force "fast" and not only "paced": IS_MAC matches iOS as well as macOS.
  // Every iOS user agent contains "like Mac OS X", so an iPhone matches — measured, not
  // assumed: the device's connect line reads `mac=true`. **iOS has therefore only ever
  // printed paced.** Whether it NEEDS the pacing is unmeasured, and the only way to find
  // out is to force "fast" there and look at the paper (README § iOS coverage has the
  // procedure). A one-directional FORCE_PACING could not ask that question.

  // reading it is `override === "paced"`, setting true sets "paced", setting false

  // 0x48, big-endian u16) and protocol version (PrinterStatusData 0xA5 → 0xB5, bytes
  // [11]*100+[12]), then picks the print task from that. We do the same to validate
  // the caller's selection. That 0xB5 reply opcode is NOT universal: the D110 answers
  // 0xB5 with too few bytes and the N1 answers 0xB4 entirely, so `protocolVersion`
  // comes back null on both and no retry changes that — identification rests on the
  // model id, not on the protocol version.
  // Every id in the table below has printed on real hardware — B1 (4096), B1 Pro
  // (4097), D11_H (528), D110 (2304), M2-H (4608), N1 (3586), B2 Pro (6912) — with

  // never been seen on a printer here. Models outside the table are reported, not
  // enforced.

  // model-level printhead figure isn't needed here and is omitted to avoid confusing

  // T50x30_m2h renders at 567 px — a deliberate ribbon margin, not the head).
  // niimbluelib has the printhead resolutions if ever needed.

  // PrintEnd (see the PAGE_PIPELINE branch in printBatch). Motivated by a D11_H
  // measurement (docs/NOTES.md, 2026-09-10): the PageEnd ack alone costs 2.0-2.7 s per
  // page, the driver sends nothing during that wait, and the printer visibly stops and
  // dries between labels — no retraction, so it is not the "job over" pause. The
  // official app prints 4 DIFFERENT labels emended together, and this driver's own
  // `copies:4` (one upload, no per-page PageEnd in between) also comes out continuous,
  // which is evidence the hardware is not what is imposing the stop.
  // It stays a diagnostic and not a setting because nobody has yet confirmed on paper
  // that the printer accepts the next page while the previous page's ack is still
  // outstanding — it might silently drop or corrupt it instead. The guarantee that
  // must hold either way: any page whose ack never comes back still ends the job as
